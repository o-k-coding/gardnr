The late morning sun beat on the flat concrete wall. Sweat left a dark, steaming trail as Jenna quickly clambered through the window. A cool breeze flowed through her long red hair, sending a shiver through her slender frame. Her brown eyes quickly scanned the quiet room, alighting upon the only open doorway. "Hello!" she called out as she strode through the door. "It's me, Jenna! I'm here with your rations". A tired grunt sounded from the bed. "Thank you Jenna. It's good to see you, I've been out of food for two days now." said the shapeless form. "You need to limit your calorie intake... and have you even left this room since last week?" Jenna frowned and wrinkled her nose.

Sighing, Jenna jogged along the roof of the apartment building. "The state of the <insert term> is getting worse" she thought. Ten years since losing electricity, and most of the citizens have still not set foot outside. She can still remember the last argument she had with the councial about it.

"Remember Jenna, the doors won't open without electricity. How do you propose to get them outside?" the councilor says distractedly as he makes notes in a ledger. "The whole team could work together to lower them safely from a window. From there we could move them to building with ground floor access and help them regain mobility" Jenna explained seemingly for the thousandth time. "Yes of course, and how exactly do you plan on fitting them through the windows, and ensuring their safety? No, better to do what we can to keep them comfortable instead and let them live peacefully."

Jenna could feel her face flush with anger. She sprinted the last few meters before leaping across the gap between the buildings. As she flew over the edge of the next roof, Jenna remembered most of the apartments in this area had a courtyard in the middle. A short skid across the conrete ended in eery silence as solid ground ran out. Jenna cursed under her breath and twisted quickly in the air looking for anything to slow her fall with. Luck stepped in to cover for her this time as she quickly grabbed a tree branch, spinning like a gymnast before dropping gracefully to the ground with a flip. "That was close, next time you fall 50 stories you will not be as lucky" she chastized herself before dusting off and climbing back up the wall to continue her deliveries for the day.

As the sun set, Jenna jogged along the road toward home. Every muscle and bone seemed to ache and sweat chilled her as the cooling air rushed by. A booming voice echoed down an alley as she passed "Hey oh J oh!". She warmed a little as a tall and solid man with blue hair ran out of the shadows and fell in stride with her. "How was your day Piers?" She asked. "Any day out in the sun is a blessing" Piers replied happily, his yellow eyes flashing in the waning sunlight. Then, as if setting with the sun, his smile began to fade. "I'm worried about the <insert term> Jenna" he said somberly. They passed the next half mile in silence. Turning a corner, they came upon a young sandy haired woman with deep green eyes. She waved and joined the growing pack as they passed. "Hi Sheba!" Piers at least had his smile back as he greeted her. "Have either of you seen Felix yet?" Sheba asked quietly. "I don't think he was delivering today". Jenna could tell Sheba was worried. Last month her brother Felix had been caught trying to scale the walls around the city. The council had cut all of their rations and imposed a curfew. "No, but I am sure he will be back at home safe and sound" Jenna said with reassurance and just a touch of annoyance. He had promised her he would not put them at risk again. She was beginning to think that the council may not actually need them for deliveries and feared what they would do if pushed too far. "I hope so..." Sheba said quietly. Time passed silently and as they neared home Jenna could see light in the windows. "See Sheba, nothing to worry about". But Jenna felt a pit opening in her stomach as Sheba began to sprint toward home. She was always able to sense things that the rest of them could not and something was definitly off. Jenna and Piers met each others eyes and sprinted after her. They  reached the ground floor window a few seconds before Sheba and leapt through after her, ready for trouble. "Felix!" Jenna shouted as she took in the scene. Sheba had reached his still form on the floor and checked his pulse "Jenna get the first aid kit. Piers help me move him onto the table." she commanded. "Careful, he's lost a lot of blood". Jenna brought the kit and sank to floor with a sob. Her vison swam as she watched them care for her only living family member.

"Wake up Jenna" Piers' eyes pierced the darkness as something warm was pressed into her hands. "Time to eat something, you've gone too long this time". "Where's Felix" she gasped. "He's sleeping now. He took quite the beating, and it wasn't a fall. Eat now, then rest. Sheba and I will keep watch tonight and tomorrow we will figure out what is going on".
